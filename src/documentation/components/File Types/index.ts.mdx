# Index File

<Meta title="Documentation/Components/File Types/index.ts" />

The primary purpose of the index file is to export your component's API publicy. It's written specifically in `.ts`, as an export file throws a warning if `.tsx`.

The standard for a component's public APIs is to expose everything in `./component` and `./variants`, as everything else is usually used in the [story](/?path=/docs/documentation-components-file-types-story-tsx--docs) or something.

<Source language="ts" code={`export * from './component'
export * from './variants'
`} />
